/*
A deque (pronounced deck) or double-ended queue is a linear collection that allows
insertion and deletion at both ends, such as described by the following interface available on
Blackboard

Prepare two classes called ArrayDeque and LinkedDeque for implementing deques which
have O(1) methods for enqueue and dequeue methods at both ends.

Do not use an existing data structure, create your own using an underlying array or nodes.
Include a driver main method to test all aspects of the class with some suitable output.
